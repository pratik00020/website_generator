## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pratik00020/website_generator.git
   ```

2. Change to project directory:

   ```bash
   cd website_generator
   ```

3. Install Frontend Dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Install Backend Dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ../be
   npm install
   ```

5. Set up Environment Variables:
   Backend:

   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit backend .env with your configuration
   ```

6. Start Frontend Development Server:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

7. Start Backend Server:
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   npm run start
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

```bash

npm run dev

```

2. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser

3. Enter a website description in the prompt box

- Example: "Create a landing page for a coffee shop"

- Example: "Build a portfolio website for a photographer"

## How It Works

1. Enter a natural language prompt describing your desired website

2. AI analyzes the prompt and generates initial website structure

3. Step-by-step creation process with real-time updates

4. Interactive file explorer and live code preview

5. Refine and iterate on the generated website
